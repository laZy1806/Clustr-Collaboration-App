Clustr is an app that encourages people to take action with their lives. When users first join, in order to start working on a goal they must join a community where they’ll be exposed to like minded individuals.

In these communities, they could engage in conversations, post questions, and share experiences with others. Most importantly, being a member of a community enables users to set related goals that appear on their profile. To support progress, the app prompts users to create personal tasks which essentially function like adding items to a checklist.

But this is where our app is different. For these “tasks”, one cannot simply just press a button to complete it. Each task on a checklist is linked to a “tool”. These tools are mini applications within the platform itself that track a user’s various activities (e.g. location or distance travelled) and we believe collecting screen-time data for apps / websites will be vital for two reasons: **first**, to verify that a user actually worked on a specific task — for example, if someone used the Nike Training Club app during a scheduled workout period; and **second**, to confirm they did not spend time on unrelated activities, such as browsing social apps like YouTube or Instagram, during a time they claimed to be studying. For the second use case, we also will offer users the option to completely shield such apps if they want absolutely no distraction.

We understand that in this day and age, it’s harder than ever for the younger generation, and even current ones, to stay focused and manage their personal ambitions. With access to the Device Activity frameworks for screen time information and Managed settings to block certain apps, we will get one step closer to providing users a more fruitful experience by helping them stick to their plans and discouraging major distractions.

App coming soon.
